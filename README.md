# DPVR-E3-Files

A bunch of things for the Deepoon (DPVR) E3 Virtual Reality headset.


## New skyboxes (`DpnPlayer/media/VrTexture/`)

- `SkyBox.jpg`
- `SkyBox_dark.jpg`

These overwrite the existing skyboxes in `C:\Program Files (x86)\DPVR\DpnPlayer\media\VrTexture`. These are used from within `DpnPlayer` -- the DPVR VR-ready version of Kodi.

## Translated video OSD

`DpnPlayer/addons/skin.deepoon1080/media/osd/fullscreen/progressbar/`

The graphics for the OSD used during video playback were all Chinese, so I've created new English versions of these.
